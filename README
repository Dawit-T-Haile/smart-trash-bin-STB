This is a smart trash bin project designed and excuted by Abel and Dawit Tadele. We are currently preparing the how-to-document and recording a video showing the complete steps which will be uploaded to our YouTube channel. The motivation behind project X is to encourage our high school classmates to separate recyclable and non-recyclable trashes while minimizing flies infestation in classrooms and school campus.
